# fileAvgCalc
Here I made a code in which has a bunch of data in a txt file and if you want to find the avgerage of how ever many files indiviually it will find the average of the data in each file and print them out

The funcationality works but there are some commenting and editing to the code I have to do before it is good for public use but for now the basic consecpt on how to read a file take values out of a file split the file and then to find the average of all of the data is all in the code.
